# CPEN-311-Labs

My implementation of the labs assigned in UBC's CPEN 311 course, not to be copied or reused in future iterations of the course.

## Project Setup

First, navigate to one of the project directories

1. **Set Quartus batch mode environment variable**
On Windows: System Properties -> (tab) Advanced -> Environment Variables and append the Quartus bin64 directory's path to the user path variable.

2. **From the project root directory, run the TCL project script**
For example, navigate to Basic_Organ_Solution and run:
`quartus_sh -t .\scripts\Basic_Organ_Solution.tcl`
